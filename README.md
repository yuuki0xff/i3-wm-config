# i3-wm-config by yuuki0xff

This is my configuration for the i3 window manager. This is based on [benkaiser/i3-wm-config](https://github.com/benkaiser/i3-wm-config).  

Uses terminator as the terminal.  

I would recommend just copying parts of my config (as certain parts, such as the start up config, may be irrelevent to you). However my workspace_controller.py script is universal.  

# Dependencies

- py3status - for changing the status bar
